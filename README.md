Design a simple role playing game using Javascript and jQuery

## Concept
Allow the user to select their player and their opponent and battle. *(Singleplayer Only)*

## Features
- A basic mode based on the requirements of the project
- Stats of player increase with every defeated enemy
- Single Attack Button which detracts hit points from the player and opponent with every attack.
- Theme of game based on Persona 5 RPG.

## Advanced Mode
- A more 'tactical' version of the basic mode, with a few more options
- An Attack button that compares the player's and opponent's attack stats with one another. The difference is dealt to the appropriate player.
- A Parry button that allows the user to block and stun their opponent. A failure leaves an open attack for the opponent.
- Base attack stats for each character are fixed, while the attack stat is a RNG between a specific number and the base stat.
- Defeating an enemy allows the user to upgrade their Health stats, Attack stats, and Parry stats.
- Additional "Boss" characters exclusive in the advanced mode only.

## Needed Improvements
- Allow user to toggle the music.
- Less randomization to attack & parry stats. Game relies little too much on RNG
